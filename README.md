#### 1. Problem Statement
       In the today’s competitive market, many companies are coming to a full realization of the importance of the customer-oriented business strategy for sustaining their competitive edge and maintaining a stable profit level. That is, companies mainly rely on the income which comes from customers. However, to create and retain customers is difficult and costly in term of marketing. As new account setup, credit searches, and advertising and promotional expenses can add up to several times the cost of efforts that might enable the firms to retain a customer (Keaveney, 1995), it is becoming an industry-wide belief that the best core marketing strategy for the future is to retain existing customers and avoid customer churn (Kim, Park, & Jeong, 2004; Kim & Yoon, 2004).
        Burez and Van den Poel (2007) indicate that there are two types of targeted approaches to managing customer churn: reactive and proactive. When a company adopts a reactive approach, it waits until customers ask the company to cancel their service relationship. In this situation, the company will offer the customer an incentive to stay. On the other hand, when a company adopts a proactive approach, it tries to identify customers who are likely to churn before they do so. The company then provides special programs or incentives for these customers to keep the customers from churning. Targeted proactive programs have potential advantages of having lower incentive costs. However, these systems may be very wasteful if churn predictions are inaccurate, because companies are wasting incentive money on customers who will not churn. Therefore, it is important to build a customer-churn prediction model as accurately as possible (Burez & Van den Poel, 2007;Van den Poel & Larivie‘re, 2004).



In today’s rapidly evolving digital financial landscape, fraud has become one of the most critical challenges faced by the banking sector. With the rise of online transactions, mobile banking, and instant payments, the potential for fraudulent activities has multiplied, posing significant risks to both institutions and customers. Traditional methods of detecting fraud often struggle to keep pace with the sophistication of modern cyber threats. Consequently, the need for more advanced, efficient, and real-time fraud detection systems has never been greater.

This project explores the application of machine learning and data analytics in detecting fraudulent activities within the banking industry. By leveraging vast datasets and powerful algorithms, our approach aims to identify suspicious patterns and anomalies with greater accuracy and speed, minimizing false positives and reducing financial losses. The study not only addresses the technical challenges but also highlights the importance of balancing security with user experience, ensuring that protective measures do not compromise the convenience of legitimate banking operations.

Ultimately, this research contributes to a safer banking environment by presenting cutting-edge solutions that adapt to evolving fraud techniques, safeguarding financial assets, and maintaining customer trust in an increasingly digital world.
